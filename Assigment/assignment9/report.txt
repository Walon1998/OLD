Dining Philosophers
a)
Everybody takes the fork and his/her left side and then waits until the right one is free, but everybody does this, so... -> Deadlock
b)
We can number the forks from 1 to 5.
And everybody has to pick up the fork with the smaller number first, and after he/she own it, she/he can try to grab the bigger one.
Similar to the bankaccount.
There aren't any deadlocks because there is now order in taking locks...
c)
Maximum is two, since there are only 5 forks
but minimum is 1 because for example in the beginning scenario only the person between fork 5 and 4 is able to eat,
 since everybody else is waiting for the other fork.
 To improve this a person could give their fork free, while they are waiting for the other fork.
